#Setup the project

We assume that you have already npm and node installed.

1. Install gulp globally on your machine 
```
sudo npm install -g gulp-cli
```
2. Open your terminal an switch to the project folder 
3. Install necessary node modules 
```
npm install
```
4. Run 'gulp' with default task to open you local server. SCSS compiler and the reference to the CSS file is already done for you.
